### What I write 

My best writings are in theoretical biology. I take concepts that are easily mixed up and I separate them.

- My [Tracer-seq discussion](https://ekernf01.github.io/tracerseq_short/) separates clonal trees from lineage trees.
- My [critique of Perturb-ATAC](https://ekernf01.github.io/genetic_interactions/) separates genetic interactions from statistical interactions.

### What I read

Curiosities 

- [Maciej Ceglowski](https://idlewords.com/about.htm) on [scurvy](https://idlewords.com/2010/03/scott_and_scurvy.htm) and [internet ads](https://idlewords.com/talks/what_happens_next_will_amaze_you.htm).
- Donat Studios for software engineering tidbits, especially [this raucous post about CSV's](https://donatstudios.com/Falsehoods-Programmers-Believe-About-CSVs)
- [Bits About Money](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/)
- Jake VanderPlas on Python for data science, especially this excellent [conda myth debunker](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/).
- The [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=blog) by Douglas Harper.
- [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/)'s amazing monthly reading lists on AI and human genetics. He also writes about all sorts of things such as [why are girl scout cookie prices outpacing inflation?](https://www.gwern.net/Girl-Scouts-and-good-governance). He follows problems with superhuman persistence.
- [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com) contains diverse, fascinating essays, but what hooked me at first was [the cost disease post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/).
- Edward Tufte's "Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative" on the Challenger disaster and the Broad Street cholera outbreak
- [Stephen M. Hedrick on disease ecology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711578/)
- [This hilarious preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10987.pdf) on arguments against the possibility of artificial general intelligence
- [Matt Lakeman](https://mattlakeman.org/), a modern-day Ibn Battuta

Technical matters

- [CodingHorror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/) on programming effectively 
- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/about/) on being delighted to do it and on [effective debugging](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/12/08/a-debugging-manifesto/).
- [John Cook](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/) on math, stats, and programming
- [`whuber`](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/919/whuber) on diverse statistical questions, including [the infamous Broad Street pump](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/297504/what-statistical-model-or-algorithm-could-be-used-to-solve-the-john-snow-cholera).
- `ttnphs` on [visualizing CCA](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/65692/how-to-visualize-what-canonical-correlation-analysis-does-in-comparison-to-what/65817#65817).
