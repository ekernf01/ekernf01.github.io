Stem cell biology has given me a real appreciation for well-calibrated statistical methods. Any given experiment that my coworkers in the Maehr lab ran was expensive and hard. Our most common measurements -- flow cytometry, imaging, and qPCR -- could take hours or a day or two. Making a batch of virus containing CRISPR guide RNAs could take days or a week or two. Running a directed differentiation could take weeks -- more if the cells die. Making a cell line could take months. So if they are going to design an screen, they really will
