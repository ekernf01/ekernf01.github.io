Doing single-cell RNA analysis for the Maehr Lab, it was a constant struggle to keep everything organized. The nightmare scenario would be to get a useful or interesting result during an hour of intensive experimentation and re-writing of code, then later discover that the code to produce that result no longer exists. I wanted to interact with the data, not be interrupted constantly to commit microscopic changes, so I wrote freezr, which saves code, plots, and console output to a designated folder just as the same code runs. Check it out at [https://github.com/ekernf01/freezr](https://github.com/ekernf01/freezr).
