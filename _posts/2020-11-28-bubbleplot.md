 `bubblegrid` helps you see your data when a plain scatterplot would be overplotted. It aggregates points within a hexagonal grid. In each grid cell, the point count is shown as the bubble size. For quantitative variables shown by color, values are averaged. See [https://github.com/maehrlab/bubblegrid](https://github.com/maehrlab/bubblegrid) for more information.
