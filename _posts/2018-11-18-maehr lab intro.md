We're a **stem cell lab** in a **diabetes center**. Stem cell biology is the hammer; Type I diabetes is the nail. The connection is rather complicated. Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease. It's not very well understood, for such a common disease, and actually it may consist of several diseases that are different on a molecular level but share clinical symptoms. The prevailing opinion is that, in most cases of type I diabetes, part of the immune system (usually T cells) destroys pancreatic beta cells (which make insulin). 

Current treatments mostly just replace the missing insulin. Replacing the missing insulin is easier said than done, and even though type I diabetes is completely treatable on paper, it can really wear down the people it affects. If we want to someday prevent or cure type I diabetes, we need to get a handle on the autoimmune aspect of the disease. 

This is not easy to do, and tons of money and effort has been spent on immunology-based T1D prevention trials that did not pan out ([example](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/103/8/2838/5036898)). Better preclinical research is badly needed. To this end, the Maehr lab is part of a big collaboration to create a new model system for type I diabetes. The scheme is to use a "humanized" mouse model. The meaning of "humanize" is to use mice as hosts for diabetes-relevant human organ systems: a human pancreas and a human adaptive immune system. 

Human organ systems are extremely difficult to procure, so the idea is to use stem-cell-derived organs instead. Our role is to make stem-cell-derived thymic epithelium. Thymic epithelium trains part of your immune system (the T cells) what to attack and what to let live, so it will be a crucial component of the autoimmune disease mechanics that we want to make accessible for study.

In order to make progress on stem-cell-derived thymic epithelium, the Maehr lab has invested heavily in recent sequencing-based technologies. I joined the lab as a bioinformatician back in September 2016, and my role is to help my colleagues derive insight from the data they produce. 

It's an amazing era to be working in molecular biology, and a big privilege to work in this lab in particular. Check out [our website](www.maehrlab.net) for more info, or read my blog for sporadic vignettes on technical topics.
