For a while, I experimented with writing all of my R packages in R markdown. In order to facilitate this, I built `kniterati`, which knits all the `Rmd` files into `R` files prior to the usual `devtools` workflow. Check it out at [https://github.com/ekernf01/kniterati](https://github.com/ekernf01/kniterati).
