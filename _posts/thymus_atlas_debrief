title: Debriefing the thymus atlas
---

The Maehr Lab recently published a paper on single-cell RNA mapping of mouse thymus development. (Find it [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29884461)). I'm putting together a post about what I learned for this project, but it's still in the oven -- stay tuned.
