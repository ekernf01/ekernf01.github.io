I just finished teaching a one-credit engineering class (part of JHU's [HEART](https://engineering.jhu.edu/education/undergraduate-studies/heart-courses/)). It was an opportunity for students and me to indulge our curiosity about a really neat topic. Epigenetics is the study of DNA packaging and decoration. DNA packaging and decoration affect how and when DNA is used, so they are fundamental to life. 

This course was also a chance learn how to navigate scientific literature purposefully in service of a specific question and then document the results of that search in a way that is easy to understand, read, and share. This is an essential part of the research process, and without it, you will never gain autonomy in a scientific job. Unfortunately, it's a skillset that many people struggle with, even more mature researchers, and it's rarely taught. Here, students spent serious time practicing these skills on a topic of their choice -- see the [project description](https://ekernf01.github.io/2021-11-15-heart-epigenetics-research_project) and an [example](https://ekernf01.github.io/2021-11-15-heart-epigenetics-research_project_example). I was really happy to have this chance to focus on digesting and reorganizing information. 





If you are curious about these topics or my take on them, or if you want to offer this as a class or workshop, most of the materials are available [here](/files/HEART epigenetics light.zip). If the YouTube hyperlinks are dead, I'm happy to send you the videos too.
