The comp bio job market is scarier than usual: 2023 was a [biotech bankruptcy bloodbath](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/biotech-bankruptcies-break-10-year-record-2023), 2024 was [a little better](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/2024-biotech-graveyard), and as far as layoffs, [2025 has been worse](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/biopharma-layoffs-first-half-year-jump-32-yoy). Academic and government sectors are also reeling from government cuts, and in the two places I have recently lived (Massachusetts and Maryland), cuts have specifically targeted large biomedical research employers (Harvard and NIH). The tech job market is [pandemically weird](https://technical.ly/professional-development/tech-job-market-trends-downturn/) and also not so hot. Anecdotally, there are lots of interesting job postings in comp bio, but each one might get *hundreds of applicants per week*, among which are many brilliant people. Some of them have [training and qualifications very similar to me](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7344351549818638336/). I applied to about 65-70 jobs and got almost no interviews (except where I had a referral). 

Here's how it went and some suggested tactics. All numbers are approximate. For accessibility or screen readers, you can scroll to the bottom to find source data for this diagram.

### What to do? 

[Increase your surface area](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/how-to-increase-your-surface-area) for good luck to land on.

- Open your search to as many companies and locations as possible. I was unable to pursue really cool opportunities in several non-Boston cities, which was sad. 
- Conduct informational interviews with people you know or people they know. Do it roughly [like this](https://managejobapplications.com/networking). I did ~30 of these. It was super interesting and enjoyable. It also got me a lot of useful advice and some merciful affirmation during a stressful time. It netted me 1 offer for a good job that I was enthusiastic about, plus one really cool near miss. 
- Establish a public reputation in an area you are interested in.

### How to establish a yeoperson blogger reputation

- Publish useful stuff: whole-ass papers are great, but so are blog posts or something in-between. Focus on your scientific agenda. Avoid personal topics.
- Publicize what you wrote on the world wide web using social networking. I use Twitter and Bluesky. (But I do not "skeet". Yuck. I "bleat".) Also consider LinkedIn, Substack, or [tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@60_secondscience). 
- Drive engagement. There are non-horrible ways to do this. 
    - Post a lot. It does not have to all be original works. Even with little pointers saying "here's why I like this", sometimes you'll land an unexpected hit [example](https://x.com/ekernf01/status/1872708023921397866), [example](https://x.com/ekernf01/status/1946606122686644581). 
    - If you comment on other people's posts in a good-faith high-effort way, that could net you additional eyeballs. 
    - For your bigger announcements that you really want eyeballs on, people love legible accomplishments: baby's first preprint; degree obtained; exam passed. Don't be afraid to juice it up with some capital letters and emojis etc. If you have real substance, people won't mind a tiny bit of cynicism about human attention. 
    - Contrarian takes can also get a lot of attention, although you might make enemies this way. Even more popular are opinions that sound contrarian, but are actually already widespread, such as anti-AI sentiment.

### What you don't need:

- You don't need native or smooth English.
- You don't need funny or charming jokes.
- You don't need a huge body of work. 
- You don't need a huge reach. 
- You don't need *everyone* who reads your work to like it. 
- You don't even need a *majority* of readers to like it, though they probably will anyway.
- You don't need perfect or complete posts. You can update them later as you learn more, or you can follow them up with "what I learned from the comments on so-and-so". 
- Not all of your work even needs to be good. Some of it can be bad. Especially according to you: [cringe indicates growth](https://writingcooperative.com/you-should-cringe-at-your-old-writing-it-means-youve-improved-4fb78ed29d67).

## Coda 

The best way to get a job is for someone to have a job and think of you. If that isn't happening yet, then you'll be better off spending a month on reputation-building than a month uploading your resume to various jobs. Why?

- You get to keep the results of your labor (connections, posts, reputation). 
- Reformatting your resume, only for it to be scrambled by a WorkDay parser, is boring and unpleasant. Building a reputation is interesting and enjoyable.
- YMMV but for the same amount of time spent, I got more opportunities rep-building than app-grinding. The opportunities were also more serious/credible and a better fit. 

I hope someone reads this and goes out to claim the public standing they have silently earned through their ivory-tower toils. I wish you good luck -- and a big landing pad for it.
