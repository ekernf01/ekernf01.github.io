### My best posts 

My best writings take concepts that are easily mixed up and separate them.

- My [Tracer-seq discussion](https://ekernf01.github.io/tracerseq_short/) separates clonal trees from lineage trees.
- My [critique of Perturb-ATAC](https://ekernf01.github.io/genetic_interactions/) separates genetic interactions from statistical interactions.
