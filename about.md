I'm Eric, and I help scientists find meaning in quantitative datasets. I've spent over a decade indulging my curiosity about many topics that contribute to this cause, especially molecular biology and applied statistics. Since 2016, I have been studying embryology and stem cell biology, and I have become interested in building predictive models of how stem cells will behave in response to various stimuli. I got my start in stem cell biology working for Rene Maehr's lab ([intro post](/about_maehrlab), [lab site](http://maehrlab.net/)) at UMass Medical School. In the fall of 2020, I started a Ph.D. in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins, and I am jointly advised between Alexis Battle ([lab site](https://battlelab.jhu.edu/)) and Patrick Cahan ([lab site](https://www.cahanlab.org/)). I'm really excited to continue full-time engagement in this strange and fascinating domain!

This is my personal blog: a venue to write about [interesting stuff](/topics), boost signals for [good work](/blogroll), and make my modest contribution to the vitality of the blogosphere. Opinions are my own.
