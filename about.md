2025 April: I have finished my Ph.D.!!! I am looking for a Boston-area biotech role with opportunities to grow towards new-to-me data types and new-to-me biological problems. If you know a company or team that seems like a good fit, please help me get in touch! Here is my [resume (pdf)](/files/Eric_Kernfeld_resume_2025_April.pdf).

# About me

Hi! I'm Eric, and I help scientists find meaning in data. For years now, I have been working towards reliable computer models of gene activity, with a focus on human stem cells. My current agenda is to understand the limits of modern gene activity models and relevant data, then outline the next steps we should take to bypass those limits. In 2020, I started a Ph.D. in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins, working on [false discovery rate control in network inference](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.23.541948v1) and [assessing predictions about genetic perturbations](https://github.com/ekernf01/perturbation_benchmarking). I am jointly advised between Alexis Battle ([lab site](https://battlelab.jhu.edu/)) and Patrick Cahan ([lab site](https://www.cahanlab.org/)). My work is heavily informed by four years providing bioinformatics support for Rene Maehr's lab ([intro post](/about_maehrlab), [lab site](http://maehrlab.net/)) at UMass Medical School. 

This is my personal blog: a venue to write about [interesting topics](/topics), boost signals for [good work](/blogroll), and make my modest contribution to the vitality of the blogosphere. Opinions are my own.

I am also a [musician](/sackbut).
