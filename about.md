### About me

My name is Eric Kernfeld. I'm a bioinformatician at UMass Medical School. I work for Rene Maehr's lab ([intro post](https://ekernf01.github.io/about_maehrlab), [lab site](http://maehrlab.net/)) in the Diabetes Center. We're interested in stem cell differention and developmental biology, and we plan to deploy what we learn about these topics in the fight against type 1 diabetes. I help the lab make meaning from next-generation sequencing datasets, which involves a lot of computation, statistics, data visualization, and writing.
