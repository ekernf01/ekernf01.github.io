My name is Eric Kernfeld. I'm a bioinformatician at UMass Medical School. I work for Rene Maehr's lab ([intro post](/about_maehrlab), [lab site](http://maehrlab.net/)) in the Diabetes Center. We're interested in stem cell differention and developmental biology, and we plan to deploy what we learn about these topics in the fight against type 1 diabetes. I help the lab make meaning from next-generation sequencing datasets, which involves a lot of computation, statistics, data visualization, and writing.

**Update: In fall 2020, I started a Ph.D. in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins!** I'm excited to continue studying stem cell identity and transcriptional regulation here at Hopkins. If you know a lab I should rotate in, or if you want to talk about related research at JHU, please scroll down and contact me!

### About the blog

This is my personal blog: a venue to write about [interesting stuff](/topics), boost signals for [good work](/blogroll), and make my modest contribution to the vitality of the blogosphere. Opinions are my own.

### About the word "blog"

"Blog" is a contraction of "web log", and "log" [is a shortening](https://www.etymonline.com/word/log#etymonline_v_12387) of "log-book", which is the book the sailors would write in after they threw a (wooden) log into the water to measure their speed against it. I suppose this blog also provides a measure of my progress. Ironically, it is no longer quantitative.
