### About me

My name is Eric Kernfeld. I'm a bioinformatician at UMass Medical School. I work for Rene Maehr's lab ([intro post](https://ekernf01.github.io/about_maehrlab), [lab site](http://maehrlab.net/)) in the Diabetes Center. We're interested in stem cell differention and developmental biology, and we plan to deploy what we learn about these topics in the fight against type 1 diabetes. I help the lab make meaning from next-generation sequencing datasets, which involves a lot of computation, statistics, data visualization, and writing.

**Update: This fall, I'll be starting a Ph.D. in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins!**

### About the blog

This is my personal blog. It is a venue for me to write about genomics, boost signals for [good work](https://ekernf01.github.io/blogroll), and make my modest contribution to the vitality of the blogosphere. This blog is not affiliated with the Maehr Lab or with the University of Massachusetts, and content appearing on this blog does not reflect the opinions of UMass or the Maehr Lab.
