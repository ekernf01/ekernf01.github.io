Hi! I'm Eric, and I help scientists find meaning in data. For years now, I have been working towards reliable computer models of gene activity, with a focus on human stem cells. The agenda of my Ph.D. was to understand the limits of modern gene activity models and relevant data. My work on [false discovery rate control in network inference](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.23.541948v1) and [assessing predictions about genetic perturbations](https://github.com/ekernf01/perturbation_benchmarking) demonstrated that we are a long way from having what we need in this domain.

My Ph.D. work was jointly supervised by Patrick Cahan ([lab site](https://www.cahanlab.org/)) and Alexis Battle ([lab site](https://battlelab.jhu.edu/)) in the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering Department. My perspective is also heavily informed by four years providing bioinformatics support for Rene Maehr's lab ([intro post](/about_maehrlab), [lab site](https://www.umassmed.edu/dcoe/diabetes-research/basic-research-labs/rene-maehr/)) at UMass Medical School. 

This is my personal blog: a venue to write about [interesting topics](/topics), boost signals for [good work](/blogroll), and make my modest contribution to the vitality of the blogosphere. Opinions are my own.

I am also a [musician](/sackbut).
