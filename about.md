Some information about you!

### More Information

I'm a bioinformatician at UMass Medical School. I work for [Rene Maehr's lab](http://maehrlab.net/) in the Diabetes Center. We're interested in stem cell differention and developmental biology, and we plan to deploy what we learn about these topics in the fight against type 1 diabetes. I help the lab make meaning from next-generation sequencing datasets, which involves a lot of computation, statistics, data visualization, and writing.
