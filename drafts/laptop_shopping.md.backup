On my last day of work at the Maehr Lab, I returned the laptop I've been using since September 2016. It was just about the beefiest MacBook available when the lab bought it for me, and from [apple-history.com](https://apple-history.com/mbp_15_retina_mid_15), this must have cost 2,499.00 USD at the time. This was a great laptop, and I really pushed it hard. The disk was constantly within 70GB of filling up, with the overflow going onto UMMS's luxurious unlimited DropBox space. I very frequently ran out of RAM, and I very infrequently shut the computer off overnight. I'm sorry; I'll explain below. Despite the abuse, the only thing that really suffered was the battery life; otherwise, it still worked great on the day I handed it back over. 

Now, I am faced with a big decision about how to equip myself for grad school. I don't know exactly what kind of work I'll be doing in the future. On the technical side, my work MacBook was a mid-2015 15-inch MacBook Pro with 

```
16GB ram; 512GB Apple SSD; 2.2GHz Intel Core I7 processor
```

. There's more here about what you can and cannot do with that amount of power. The programs I used the most were the Terminal, R+Rstudio, Python + Jupyter, MacDown, MS Word/Excel/PowerPoint, Apple's Preview, and Adobe Illustrator; I expect to continue to need those or equivalents. This is a great baseline to help eyeball my grad school needs.

#### My decision

After some shopping, I decided to upgrade my mid-2016 personal laptop and hold on for as long as I can without buying new. I had a lot of fun [taking off the back and installing a new 512GB SSD](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/upgrade-dell-xps-13-ssd), and with that upgrade finished, the laptop has

```
8GB ram; 512GB XPG SSD; 2.3GHz Intel Core I5 processor
```

. In order to make this serve my needs, I am cautiously starting down the infinite rabbit hole that is Linux, and I am entering the rabbit hole of free and open source software. I hope to get something written soon about making that switch.
