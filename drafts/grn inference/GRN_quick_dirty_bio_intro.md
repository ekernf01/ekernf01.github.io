This post is part of the GRN series. Check out the [intro](https://ekernf01.github.io/GRN_intro).

This is a very quick and dirty introduction to what biologists call **the central dogma:**

## DNA ==> RNA ==> Protein

For thousands of years, people have known that living things pass on traits to their offspring, and we have taken advantage of that for selective breeding of useful organisms -- notably clever sheep dogs and big, juicy ears of corn. For many important traits such as size, this is a gradual process, but in the 1850s and 1860s, the botanical experiements of an Austrian named [Gregor Mendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel) established a remarkable fact: heredity is carried in discrete units known as genes. This post series is about how those genes are put into action on a molecular level.

Genes are made of a polymer (a repeating molecule) called DNA. It has four subunits, also called "bases" or "nucleotides." These are (A)denine, (C)ytosine, (G)uanine, and (T)hymine. When the cell wants to use a gene, it first **transcribes** a copy of the DNA into a very similar substance called RNA. That's **transcription**. The **RNA** then gets moved and changed. Eventually, it gets used as instructions to make **proteins**. This is called **translation**. Proteins do most jobs for the cell, controlling cell shape/motion, pH, salt/ion flow, energy production, modifying other proteins, and more. Some proteins bind to DNA and activate or repress transcription, and those proteins are called **transcription factors**. These **transcription factors** recognize 4- to 12-nucleotide sequence of DNA and can sometimes anchor stably where these sequences are found. For example, my favorite transcription factor, FOXN1, often binds DNA at occurrences of GACGC. These sequences, like GACGC, are called **transcription factor binding motifs.**

### Other important info

- Some RNAs can already do stuff without ever being used to make protein. These RNAs can operate in many different ways, and they are not completely categorized, but some are called "microRNAs" and others are called "long noncoding RNAs." They are harder to measure than regular RNAs.
- Each gene can have multiple **isoforms**, because the RNA transcript gets **spliced** (chopped up and mashed back together with pieces missing). Different isoforms can work differently.
- **Enhancers** are pieces of DNA that are not genes, but they help control the activity of nearby genes, often by serving as a landing pad for transcription factors. (Thus, they often contain transcription factor binding motifs.) There are tens of thousands of genes in the human genome, but there are hundreds of thousands of enhancers. Sometimes, the same gene will be active in two similar cell types, but it will be controlled by different enhancers.
- The way that DNA is packaged (**"chromatin state"**) is very important for the control of transcription. As a proxy for gene activity, people often measure whether a gene or an enhancer is accessible to DNA chopping enzymes or whether it is packaged with certain "active marks". These assays measure **chromatin state.**
