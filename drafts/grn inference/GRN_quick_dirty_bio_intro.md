This post is part of the GRN series. Check out the [intro](https://ekernf01.github.io/GRN_intro).

This is a very quick and dirty introduction to what biologists call **the central dogma:**

## DNA ==> RNA ==> Protein

DNA is what genes are made of. When the cell wants to use a gene, it first **transcribes** a copy of the DNA into RNA. The RNA then gets moved and changed. Eventually, it gets used as instructions to make **proteins**. This is called **translation**. Proteins do jobs for the cell, controlling cell shape/motion, pH, salt/ion flow, energy production, modifying other proteins, and more. (Some RNA can do stuff without ever being used to make protein.)


**Transcription** means **gene activity** (generally) and **copying DNA into RNA** (specifically). **Transcripts** are pieces of RNA.

**Translation** means **using RNA as instructions to make protein**.
