This is not a standalone post. Check out the [intro](https://ekernf01.github.io/GRN_intro) to this series.



- The [sci-ATAC atlas](http://atlas.gs.washington.edu/mouse-atac/) covers eight organs in the adult mouse.

- Large, diverse collections of single-cell RNA data are emerging very fast right now. Some notable examples done with mice include the [MCA](http://bis.zju.edu.cn/MCA/), the [Tabula Muris](https://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org/), the [sci-RNA embryo data](http://atlas.gs.washington.edu/hub/), the [mouse gastrulation map](https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/MouseGastrulation2018/), the [other mouse gastrulation map](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-017-0013-z), and the [developing endoderm atlas](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1127-1). Similar efforts have mapped out the lineage tree for all major cell types in [the zebrafish??? link ???]() and [the planarium ??? link ???](). I don't know how things are progressing for human data, but you can check out the [human cell atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) for updates.
