I"—<p>In the <a href="https://ekernf01.github.io/GRN_intro">intro</a>, I discussed the puzzle of multicellular life: many cell types, one genome. I also followed up by discussing <a href="https://ekernf01.github.io/GRN_stat_issues">the many statistical issues</a> that arise. Thereâ€™s a very cool paper from 1999 that brings a lot of clarity to this situation, and here I have space to dig into it a bit.</p>
