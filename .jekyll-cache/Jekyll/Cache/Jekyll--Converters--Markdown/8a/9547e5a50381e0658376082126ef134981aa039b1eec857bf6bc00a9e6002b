<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bubblegrid</code> helps you see your data when a plain scatterplot would be overplotted. It aggregates points within a hexagonal grid. In each grid cell, the point count is shown as the bubble size. For quantitative variables shown by color, values are averaged.
