I"j<p>My name is Eric Kernfeld. I’m a bioinformatician at UMass Medical School. I work for Rene Maehr’s lab (<a href="https://ekernf01.github.io/about_maehrlab">intro post</a>, <a href="http://maehrlab.net/">lab site</a>) in the Diabetes Center. We’re interested in stem cell differention and developmental biology, and we plan to deploy what we learn about these topics in the fight against type 1 diabetes. I help the lab make meaning from next-generation sequencing datasets, which involves a lot of computation, statistics, data visualization, and writing.</p>

<p><strong>Update: In fall 2020, I started a Ph.D. in the <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a> at Johns Hopkins!</strong> I’m excited to continue studying stem cell identity and transcriptional regulation here at Hopkins. If you know a lab I should rotate in, or if you want to talk about related research at JHU, please scroll down and contact me!</p>
