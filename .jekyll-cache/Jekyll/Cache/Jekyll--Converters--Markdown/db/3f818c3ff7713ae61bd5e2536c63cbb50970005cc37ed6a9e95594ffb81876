I"B<p>Neural networks are exploding through AI at the same pace as single-cell technology in genomics and GWAS consortia in genetics â€“ that is to say, very quickly. For one example, ImageNet error rates decreased tenfold from 2010 to 2017 (<a href="http://image-net.org/challenges/talks_2017/imagenet_ilsvrc2017_v1.0.pdf">source</a>), but people are also now using neural networks to <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/">play StarCraft at a superhuman level</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA">synthesize and manipulate photorealistic images of faces</a>, and yes, also to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5737331/">analyze single-cell genomics data</a>. This seems like a class of models I should consider learning to work with.</p>
