I"J<p>Back in the Maehr lab, any given experiment that my coworkers ran was expensive and hard. Our most common measurements – flow cytometry, imaging, and qPCR – could take hours or a day or two. Making a batch of virus containing CRISPR guide RNAs could take days or a week or two. Running a directed differentiation could take weeks or a month or two, especially if the cells died. Making a cell line could take months. So if they are going to design an screen, they really want a good chance to find something in there that works for whatever result they are trying to obtain.</p>
