Eric Kernfeld is a trombonist specializing in European repertoire from 1450 to 1650. Producing "a mellifluous tone that curls around the voices of the singers" (Washingon Post), he has made professional appearances in Boston and alongside Folger Consort in Washington, DC. He began his musical career on euphonium, taught by Aaron Tindall and Velvet Brown, and he studied sackbut under Jane Hershey and Liza Malamut. Eric is also a professional scientist, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
