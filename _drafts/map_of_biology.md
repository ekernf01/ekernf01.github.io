Biologists like big words. This is a considerable impediment to acquisition of -- uhh, makes it hard to pick up from scratch. In a typical what-do-you-do-for-a-living conversation, everything starts to sound the same. My family asked me to make a map instead, showing the fields, the relationships among them, and the big questions in each. 

- Developmental biology: how does an early embryo, which has no obvious front, back, top, bottom, left, right, or internal specialization, turn into an organism with arms, legs, eyes, and so on?
- Stem cell biology: how do we take cells from an early embryo (or other systems with useful developmental potential) and manipulate them to produce systems of value for medicine? 
- Biochemistry and molecular biology: What usually-chemical mechanisms 
- Genetics: How are traits inherited? Given that a gene is (usually) the basic unit of inheritance, what does each gene do?
- Epigenetics: How are genes packaged, decorated, and turned on and off? When does this matter to other big questions?
- Cell biology: Given that a cell is (usually) the basic unit of life, how do cells organize themselves and interact with their environment?

Not included: metabolism, physiology, microbiology, evolution, ecology, virology, biophysics, mathematical biology, systems biology, neuroscience
